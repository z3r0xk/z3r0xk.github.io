This repository contains solutions to coding problems I solve during my last three months of military service. The focus is on mastering fundamental topics such as arrays, hashing, stacks, queues, etc., while exploring key techniques like two pointers, sliding window, prefix sums, and more. Additionally, I delve into algorithms like sorting and searching, emphasizing not just implementation but also understanding how and why specific techniques or approaches are effective or suboptimal in different scenarios. <br>

### Arrays and hashing**
The first section, “Arrays and hashing,” covers several key problems and solutions related to array manipulation and hash-based data structures. Here’s a summary of the main topics:
- **Contains Duplicates**: This problem involves finding duplicate elements in an array. Solutions include brute force, sorting, and using a set data structure.
- **Valid Anagram**: Determining if two strings are anagrams of each other. Approaches include sorting and using hash maps.
- **Two Sum**: Finding two numbers in an array that add up to a target sum. An efficient solution uses a hash map.
- **Group Anagrams**: Grouping strings that are anagrams of each other. A solution using hash maps and frequency arrays is discussed.
- **Top K Frequent Elements**: Finding the k most frequent elements in an array. Solutions include using frequency arrays, hash maps, and bucket sort.
- **Product of Array Except Self**: Calculating the product of all elements except the current one. An efficient solution using prefix and postfix products is presented.
- **Longest Consecutive Sequence:** Finding the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. Solutions include using sets and sorting.

These problems cover various techniques such as using hash-based data structures, sorting approaches to solve array and string manipulation problems efficiently.
